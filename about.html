                <p class="padText">This project began as a learning exercise in DOM Manipulation using AJAX requests and
                    Javascript/JQuery in conjuction
                    with the Scryfall API. It features the ability to search for individual cards, which then appear as
                    clickable thumbnails in the virtual
                    binder below. The cards appear 9 at a time, just as they would in a physical collection. It also has
                    the ability to search and display
                    entire sets in the same way, along with brief information about it. Previously searched cards and
                    sets can be recalled, undone or cleared.

                        <p class="padText">Future development plans include completely styling the page with an improved
                            UI, in addition to improved and more efficient AJAX functionality. The binder will also be made
                            to include no more than 9 cards at a time, and start a new page upon a 10th addition.  Future 
                            releases are also planned to have integration with multiple API's to display other
                            sports and non-sports collectible cards as well as current financial value. They will also
                            feature the ability to store and save custom sets through social media or other platforms.

                        <p class="padText">Although the application currently only displays Magic: The Gathering cards, no knowledge 
                            of this particular game is required. Try it yourself, and search for classic cards such as Force of Will, 
                            Master Transmuter, or Riptide Director. For the set search function, try and view classics such as Alpha, Tempest,
                            or Mirage. Just about anyone might find artwork or flavor text that catches their eye.

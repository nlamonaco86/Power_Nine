A virtual collectible card binder 

by Nicholas La Monaco

This is application intended to virtually display a trading card collection, just like you would in a physical binder

This will be able to search for cards and display them on a 3x3 grid, and turn the page backwards or forwards as you would in a physical binder

It will eventually be able to display entire sets as well as relevant info for them

Another goal is functionality to save and share your "binders" with friends through social media & e-mail etc. 

THe initial version will use Scryfall API for Magic: The Gathering, but eventually expand to search other sports and non-sports collectible cards
